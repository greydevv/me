  "From a young age, I’ve always been fascinated by art. I spent much of my childhood drawing and painting, in and out of art classes. There was something about creating something from nothing it that I found intriguing.",
  "When I was introduced to my first computer at a young age, I was hooked – I instantly found ways to combine my love for art and new obsession with technology. Hours were spent programming simple video games on Scratch and listing them publicly for others to try out.",
  "In high school, I picked up 3D modeling and VFX in Blender. I found myself wanting to enhance my experience and began learning Python with the intent of developing Blender plugins. For me, that was the catalyst into computer science. Since then, computer science has become my passion, study, and career.",
